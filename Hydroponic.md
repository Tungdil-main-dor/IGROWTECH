Hydroponics - the process of growing plants in sand, gravel, or liquid, with added nutrients but without soil. The hanging gardens of Babylon, the floating gardens of the Aztecs of Mexico and those of the Chinese are examples of 'Hydroponic' culture. Throughout the last century, scientists and horticulturists experimented with different methods of hydroponics. Later in the century, hydroponics was even integrated into the space program! :

There are many benefits of Hydroponics. Below are just a few:

    - The yields are much greater than in traditional, soil agriculture.
    - Hydroponics give people the ability to grow in parts of the world where
      the soil just cannot support crops.
    - It eliminates entirely the need for pesticide use, and as a result, makes our air, water,
      soil and food a large amount cleaner.


There are many different associated disciplines of hydroponics. Aeroponics is the process of growing plants where the roots are suspended in the air while nutrient solution is delivered in the form of a fine mist. Aquaponics combines aquaculture with hydroponics, and is where the excretion of fish is used as the plant's nutrients.

In addition to that, there are multiple different techniques which one can choose from when planning to do a hydroponics project.

## I.Deep Water Culture:

  In Deep Water Culture, plants are grown in containers of nutrient solution. The roots of the plant are suspended just above the solution, allowing enough oxygen to get to the roots. The resovoir for this technique may be as simple as a glass jar, or larger containers with enough space for multiple plants. In all cases, however, the resovoir should be either a dark colour, or have a cover over it, to prevent light getting in. If light does get in, there is the possibility for algae to grow, which takes nutrients away from the plants.

## II.Nutrients Film Technique
In continuous-flow solution culture, also known as the NFT or Nutrient Film Technique, the nutrient solution constantly flows past the roots. This is the method I will be using. This method gives you the ability to make changes to things such as pH levels, and EC (electrical conductivity) levels. We will go over these later. With this method, you must be careful to properly regulate the flow of water. A flow that is too fast will result in nutrient deficiency, and a flow too slow will also result in the same.
