# IGROWTECH   Some usefull thing about automated-growing.


IGROWTECH is a project aimed at automating the implementation of hydroponics, the idea came as a result of studies previously conducted.

As I was previously interested in gardening and plants, this idea of "hydroponics" really caught my attention. 

The idea is to grow plants without using soil, and the result is environmentally friendly: the products taste just as good, but only 10% of the water used in traditional soil cultivation is used. This obviously helps to reduce our water consumption as a society, and means that you can grow delicious fresh fruit and vegetables at home.
The advantage of this project is that it does not require a lot of materials and the cost of building such equipment is relatively low compared to other similar projects. It is interesting to note the possibility of expanding the size of the system as needed, I also thought that I could make good use of my Raspberry Pi in this project, and I will explain how very soon!

I would just like to clarify that this is not a step-by-step instruction guide, but rather a way for me to document my project and share it with others.
