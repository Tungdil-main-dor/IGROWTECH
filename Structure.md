# IN PROGRESSE

For ease of use, a wooden structure mounted on casters is used to move the system more easily. I chose the DWC system (Deep Water Culture) for practical reasons, such as being able to pass through the various doors that make up the housing.

**Wooden structure of the system** :

    
    Fir rafters 65 cm                                     x4
    Fir rafters 52 cm                                     x5   (one for the support of the upper centre tray)
    Fir rafters 71 cm                                     x4
    Farge fir rafters 190 cm                              x1
    Water-repellent anthracite medium panel  60*80*3 cm   x2
    Screws several different lengths
    Water-repellent sealer
    Metal angle iron                                      x12
    


After having a cup of tea on the anthracite tray, I realized that it wasn't really water repellent...So I bought a sealer and put 3 successive coats on the whole system.

## Water tank

After building the wooden structure, I chose a black opaque tank, place the different holes with a blue marker. Then drill these, either with a drill bit for the pipes, or with a hole saw for the pots.

## Final step

Once all the elements are assembled (relays board, raspberry pi, cabling) the system looks like this.
