# IN PROGRESSE

For ease of use, a wooden structure mounted on casters is used to move the system more easily. I chose the DWC system (Deep Water Culture) for practical reasons, such as being able to pass through the various doors that make up the housing.

Wooden structure of the system :

    
    Fir rafters 65 cm                                     x4
    Fir rafters 52 cm                                     x5   ( one for the support of the upper centre tray )
    Fir rafters 71 cm                                     x4
    Farge fir rafters 190 cm                              x1
    Water-repellent anthracite medium panel  60*80*3 cm   x2
    Screws several different lengths
    Water-repellent sealer
    
After having a cup of tea on the anthracite tray, I realized that it wasn't really water repellent...So I bought a sealer and put 3 successive coats on the whole system.
